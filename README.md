## Description

Test assignment

Using React, TypeScript (mandatory), RTK Query, React Router DOM 6, JSON Placeholder and FSD architecture make a simple application:

1. Main page - list of posts (infinite scroll + virtualization)
2. Each post in the list is a string: number + title + description trimmed with "..." if it doesn't fit + "view" button
3. The "view" button leads to a separate root where full information about the post is displayed in any form + the "back" button.

The result of the test job is expected to be a link to a GitHub repository, with a deployment of the result (GitHub pages) or any other.
